/*
 * This header declares a set of functional-style high-order metafunctions
 * 
 * Algorithms which work with sequences are dessigned to work with sequences
 * represented by lists (tml::list) and pairs of iterators.
 * 
 * The library provides the same functionality via two naming conventions:
 *  - Functional naming convention: Algorithms have common names used in functional 
 *    programming, such as 'tml::map', 'tml::fold', etc.
 *  
 *  - C++ (STL) naming convention: The names mimic those from the Standard Library
 *    <algoritm> header: 'tml::transform', 'tml::accumulate', etc. 
 * 
 * The implementation uses the functional convention by default.
